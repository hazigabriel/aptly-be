Parsing Instructions:

Extract Personal Information:  
  Find and extract the name, email, phone, address, LinkedIn, GitHub, website, and about details from the raw resume text.
  Ensure correct parsing by detecting common patterns for emails, phone numbers, and URLs.
  If any of these values are missing, assign them a null value.

Extract Experience:  
  Capture job titles, companies, locations, employment dates, job descriptions, and skills or technologies used.
  If a project is mentioned under a job role, include it in the experience section's description but also maintain it in the separate projects section.
  Ensure dateRange is formatted correctly (YYYY-MM-DD).
  Extract detailed job responsibilities and achievements directly from the resume text.
  Additionally, extract a list of technologies, tools or skills used for each experience entry (under the field "skills").
  If no experiences are found, return an empty array. For missing fields within a job entry, use null values.

Extract Volunteering:
  If the resume contains any voluntary roles, include them under the \`volunteering\` array. For each item, extract the organization, position, location, dateRange, and a brief summary.
  If no volunteering information is found, return an empty array.
  If any nested value is missing within a volunteering entry, assign it null.

Extract Education:  
  Identify degree, field of study, institution, location, and dates from the resume text.
  If no education data is found, return an empty array. Missing nested fields should be null.

Extract Skills:  
  Categorize skills into groups like "Frontend Development", "Backend", "Tools", etc.
  Each group must have a "name" and a "keywords" array listing relevant tools, languages, or technologies.
  Example:
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "Frontend Development",
      "keywords": ["React", "Next.js", "JavaScript"]
    }
  ]
  If no skills are found, return an empty array.

Extract Certifications:  
  Find certification names, issuing organizations, and dates from the resume text.
  Return an empty array if none are found. Missing nested fields should be set to null.

Extract Projects:  
  Identify personal or professional projects, their descriptions, links, and skills or technologies used.
  If mentioned under experience, still list them separately in the projects section.
  Return an empty array if none are found. Use null for missing nested fields.

Extract Languages & Interests:  
  Extract spoken languages and their proficiency levels.
  Also capture interests if explicitly mentioned.
  Use empty arrays when either section is not available.

export const ENHANCE_RESUME_PROMPT = `You are an expert in resume optimization. Your task is to modify the provided \`resume\` object to better fit the given job description while ensuring accuracy and integrity—no false or misleading information should be introduced. However, you should enhance the resume without summarizing any details by strategically incorporating relevant keywords and phrasing from the job description where applicable. 

The output must strictly retain the original JSON format without any structural changes—do not alter keys, nesting, or formatting. Modify fields such as experience descriptions, skills, and projects to emphasize alignment with the job requirements. If relevant details are missing, refine the phrasing to highlight transferable skills and experiences without fabricating facts.

DO NOT:
- Output any explanations or additional text.
- Alter or remove existing fields or keys.
- Introduce false or misleading information.

DO:
- Refine descriptions to align with the job's requirements.
- Enhance existing experiences with relevant keywords.

- \`resume\`: A JSON object containing resume data.
- \`jobDescription\`: A string containing the job posting details.

### Expected Output:
**Return only the updated \`resume\` object in valid JSON format.**  
Ensure it is directly usable as a JavaScript object (without markdown formatting, backticks, or escape sequences).`
